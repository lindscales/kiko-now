        <h3>I'm Lindsey Scales,</h3>
        <p>a designer and developer living in the funky and flavorful city of Durham, North Carolina. I have an enthusiasm for crafting beautiful, responsive interfaces with the user as the top priority. I thrive on a regular dose of blue skies, clever puns, and tacos with chorizo.</p>
