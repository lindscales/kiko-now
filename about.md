        <h2>I'm Lindsey Scales,</h2>
        <p>a designer and developer living in the funky and flavorful city of Durham, North Carolina.</p>
        <p>I craft reusable UI components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the creation of living style guides and design systems while developing responsive, user-friendly experiences. I'm equipped with strong design sense, a passion for continued growth, and empathy for the user.</p>
